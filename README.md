## Why XHamster Downloader

XHamster video pages can expose multiple media variants and player states, which makes generic download tools noisy and unreliable. A loose scan can surface the wrong asset or fail once the page swaps between different delivery methods during playback.

XHamster Downloader is built to simplify that workflow. Start the video, let the extension detect the supported stream, choose the quality you want, and export the result as MP4 from inside the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported XHamster video sources from active watch pages
- Multi-source video detection including initials, xplayer, HTML5 video, and CDN monitoring
- Lists available quality variants when present
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Exports MP4 files for simpler offline viewing
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Automatic saving into a dedicated XHAMSTER folder
- Works on all xHamster domains and regional mirrors
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open xHamster and visit a video page.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the stream.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button.
5. Choose the quality or stream option you want.
6. Download the video as MP4.
7. Save the final file locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from XHamster

1. Install XHamster Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Open xHamster and sign in if the page you want requires account access.
3. Visit the video page you want to keep.
4. Let the player load fully and press play.
5. Click the in-page download button on the player, or open the extension popup.
6. Review the quality options shown by the extension.
7. Select the resolution you want if multiple options appear.
8. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported XHamster video sources (HLS, direct MP4)
- Output: MP4

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, move between devices, or archive locally.

## Who It's For

- XHamster viewers who want offline copies of supported videos
- Users who prefer a browser extension over manual extraction
- People archiving videos they already have access to in the browser
- Users who want a simple MP4 download workflow
- Anyone who needs downloads to work across xHamster mirror domains

## Common Use Cases

- Save an XHamster video for later viewing
- Export the best available quality as MP4
- Avoid manual source extraction from the player
- Keep offline copies for personal playback
- Download from xHamster mirror sites when the main domain is unavailable

## Troubleshooting

**The extension is not detecting the video**
Start playback first and wait for the player to initialize the active source.

**No quality selector appears**
Some pages expose only one usable stream, so only one option may be available.

**The detected source seems incomplete**
Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**The download stopped partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the download.

**The page requires account or paid access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.
